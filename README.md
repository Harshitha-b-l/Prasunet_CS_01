This project implements a Caesar Cipher encryption program in Java, enabling users to encrypt a text message by shifting each letter based on a specified shift value, a core technique in cryptography. The program accepts user input via the command line for the shift value and text to be encrypted, ensuring flexibility and customization. It handles both uppercase and lowercase letters while preserving non-alphabetic characters in the encrypted output. Implemented in Java, the project utilizes the Scanner class for user input and StringBuilder for efficient string manipulation, facilitating seamless interaction and robust encryption capabilities.
